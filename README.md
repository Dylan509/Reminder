# Reminder
Reminder is a simple iOS app developed using SwiftUI and Coredata which has features like Add, Delete, Edit and send notification based on date provided. This is a basic app that reminds you about your friends' birthdates in case you forget to wish them a Happy Birthday. 

This project was made for fun to try out SwiftUI and see how it interacts with other layers of the application now that don't have view controllers. I am still learning and thus this project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the ideas put accross in WWDC videos and in the documentation.

##Issues
This app still has some design issues. I'm still adding features, updating and fixing bugs whenever I came across. Thank you.
